## How to play

- The game board is represented by cells numbered from 1 to 9. To make a move in a cell, you need to enter the number of that cell.

- The game alternates between "X" and "O". Each player, on his turn, must enter a cell number and make a move in that cell.

- The winner is declared when three "X" or three "O" are found in the same row, column or diagonal.

- If the board is full and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Rules of the Game

- The game board is a 3x3 square.

- Players take turns to make moves and fill the cells on the game board.

- A winner is declared when three "X" or three "O" are found in the same row, column or diagonal.

- If the board is full and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
